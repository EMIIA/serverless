# Plugins

The Serverless plugin System is at the core of the Serverless framework.

The main goals of the plugin system are:

- Separation of CLI configuration and plugin logic
  - We want any plugin author to be able to easily create new commands within the Serverless framework and extend existing commands. To achieve this we've created a strong separation between CLI and plugins that has clear interfaces between each other.
- Separation between logic of different plugins
  - Different plugins need to have an easy way to run independently and after each other without defining dependencies between each other.
- Greater Extensibility
  - Plugins need to be able to easily integrate into the lifecycle of a command independent of other Plugins that are running and can extend the functionality of Serverless easily.

## Concepts

### Plugin

A plugin encapsulates commands (and corresponding lifecycle events) and hooks in a shareable way. A plugin is not forced to provide both, they can only consist of a list of commands and lifecycle events or only of hooks.

### Command

A command represents a CLI command that can be called by a user, e.g. `serverless deploy` would be the `deploy` command.

A command has no logic, but simply defines the CLI configuration (e.g. command, subcommands, parameters) and the lifecycle events for this particular command. Every command defines its own lifecycle events, so different commands can have completely different lifecycles.

The commands that come with Serverless (e.g. `deploy`, `remove`, ...) are implemented in the exact same way as commands built by other users. This means that lifecycle events we define for our commands do not have any special meaning in Serverless or for other plugins. Every command is free to have its own lifecycle events, none of them are more special than others.

```javascript
'use strict';

class MyPlugin {
  constructor() {
    this.commands = {
      deploy: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'resources',
          'functions'
        ]
      },
    };
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

We automatically put the name of the command in front of lifecycle events when they are used for hooks.
So in a hook the following syntax needs to be used.

***CommandName:LifecycleEventName***

Which would be **deploy:resources**, and **deploy:functions** in a hook definition (which we will show in more detail below).

In addition to the lifecycle events defined here we will create 2 additional events for each:

1. `before:CommandName:LifecycleEventName`
2. `after:CommandName:LifecycleEventName`

Following the above example weâ€™ll have these lifecycle events for our `myPlugin` plugin:

For the **deploy:resources** lifecycleEvent:

- `before:deploy:resources`
- `deploy:resources`
- `after:deploy:resources`

For the **deploy:functions** lifecycleEvent:

- `before:deploy:functions`
- `deploy:functions`
- `after:deploy:functions`

These names will be used as hooks to include plugin logic. This allows to set up lifecycle events with generic names, but still make sure they are only executed for specific commands.

You can also nest commands, e.g. if you want to provide a command `serverless deploy single` you can simply nest commands as defined in the following example. Those nested commands have their own lifecycle events and do not inherit them from their parents.

```javascript
'use strict';

class MyPlugin {
  constructor() {
    this.commands = {
      deploy: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'resources',
          'functions'
        ],
        commands: {
          single: {
            lifecycleEvents: [
              'resources',
              'functions'
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    }
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### Hook

Hooks allow to connect specific lifecycle events to functions in a plugin. In the constructor of your class you define a `hooks` variable that the Plugin System will use once a specific command is running. Any hook can bind to any lifecycle event from any command, not just from commands that the same plugin provides.

This allows to extend any command with additional functionality.

```javascript
'use strict';

class Deploy {
  constructor() {
    this.commands = {
      deploy: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'resources',
          'functions'
        ]
      },
    };

    this.hooks = {
      'before:deploy:resources': this.beforeDeployResources,
      'deploy:resources': this.deployResources,
      'after:deploy:functions': this.afterDeployFunctions
    };
  }

  beforeDeployResources() {
    console.log('Before Deploy Resources');
  }

  deployResources() {
    console.log('Deploy Resources');
  }

  afterDeployFunctions() {
    console.log('After Deploy Functions');
  }
}

module.exports = Deploy;
```


# Adding custom plugins

Serverless is extendable through plugins. Plugins can provide new CLI commands or hook into existing plugins to extend their functionality.

Serverless uses the plugin infrastructure to run the core plugins. The plugin infrastructure is extendable by third party developers too. Using the same system, you can extend the framework to suit your custom needs.

Let's take a look into this now.

## Installing a plugin

First we need to install the corresponding plugin in the services root directory with the help of npm:

`npm install --save custom-serverless-plugin`.

Note: Custom plugins are added on a per service basis and are not applied globally

## Adding the plugin to a service

We need to tell Serverless that we want to use the plugin inside our service. We do this by adding the name of the plugin to the `plugins` section in the `serverless.yml` file.

```yml
# serviceXYZ serverless.yml file
plugins:
  - custom-serverless-plugin
```

Plugins might want to add extra information which should be accessible to Serverless. The `custom` section in the `serverless.yml` file is the place where you can add necessary
configurations for your plugins (the plugins author / documentation will tell you if you need to add anything there):

```yml
plugins:
  - custom-serverless-plugin

custom:
  customkey: customvalue
```

## Load order

Keep in mind that the order you define your plugins matters. When Serverless loads all the [core plugins](../lib/plugins) and then the custom plugins in the order you've defined them.

```yml
plugins:
  - plugin1
  - plugin2
```

In this case `plugin1` is loaded before `plugin2`.

### Serverless instance

The `serverless` instance which enables access to the whole Serverless setup during runtime is passed in as the first parameter to the plugin constructor.

```javascript
'use strict';

class MyPlugin {
  constructor(serverless, options) {
    this.serverless = serverless;
    this.options = options;

    this.commands = {
      log: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'serverless'
        ],
      },
    };

    this.hooks = {
      'log:serverless': this.logServerless.bind(this)
    }
  }

  logServerless() {
    console.log('Serverless instance: ', this.serverless);
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```

### Options and shortcuts

Each (sub)command can have multiple options (and corresponding shortcuts if available).

Options are passed in with a double dash (`--`) like this: `serverless function deploy --function functionName`.

Shortcuts are passed in with a single dash (`-`) like this: `serverless function deploy -f functionName`

The `options` object will be passed in as the second parameter to the constructor of your plugin.

```javascript
'use strict';

class Deploy {
  constructor(serverless, options) {
    this.serverless = serverless;
    this.options = options;

    this.commands = {
      deploy: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'functions'
        ],
        options: {
          function: {
            usage: 'Specify the function you want to deploy (e.g. "--function myFunction")'
          }
        }
      },
    };

    this.hooks = {
      'deploy:functions': this.deployFunction.bind(this)
    }
  }

  deployFunction() {
    console.log('Deploying function: ', this.options.function);
  }
}

module.exports = Deploy;
```

#### Mark options as required

Options can be marked as required. This way the plugin manager will automatically raise an error if a required option
is not passed in via the CLI. You can mark options as required with the help of `required: true` inside the options
definition.

```javascript
'use strict';

class Deploy {
  constructor(serverless, options) {
    this.options = options;

    this.commands = {
      deploy: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'functions'
        ],
        options: {
          function: {
            usage: 'Specify the function you want to deploy (e.g. "--function myFunction")',
            required: true
          }
        }
      },
    };

    this.hooks = {
      'deploy:functions': this.deployFunction.bind(this)
    }
  }

  deployFunction() {
    console.log('Deploying function: ', this.options.function);
  }
}

module.exports = Deploy;
```

#### Define shortcuts for options

Options can also provide shortcuts. Shortcuts make it more convenient to enter long commands. Serverless will
translate shortcuts into options under the hood which means that the option the shortcut belongs to will be replaced with the value of the shortcut (if the shortcut is given).

You can define shortcuts by setting the `shortcut` property in the options definition.

**Note:** A shortcut should be unique inside of a plugin.

```javascript
'use strict';

class Deploy {
  constructor(serverless, options) {
    this.options = options;

    this.commands = {
      deploy: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'functions'
        ],
        options: {
          function: {
            usage: 'Specify the function you want to deploy (e.g. "--function myFunction" or "-f myFunction")',
            required: true,
            shortcut: 'f'
          }
        }
      },
    };

    this.hooks = {
      'deploy:functions': this.deployFunction.bind(this)
    }
  }

  deployFunction() {
    console.log('Deploying function: ', this.options.function);
  }
}

module.exports = Deploy;
```

## Provider specific plugins

Plugins can be provider specific which means that they are bound to a provider.

**Note:** Binding a plugin to a provider is optional. Serverless will always consider your plugin if you don't specify a `provider`.

The provider definition should be added inside the plugins constructor:

```javascript
'use strict';

class ProviderDeploy {
  constructor(serverless, options) {
    this.serverless = serverless;
    this.options = options;

    // set the providers name here
    this.provider = 'providerName';

    this.commands = {
      deploy: {
        lifecycleEvents: [
          'functions'
        ],
        options: {
          function: {
            usage: 'Specify the function you want to deploy (e.g. "--function myFunction")',
            required: true
          }
        }
      },
    };

    this.hooks = {
      'deploy:functions': this.deployFunction.bind(this)
    }
  }

  deployFunction() {
    console.log('Deploying function: ', this.options.function);
  }
}

module.exports = ProviderDeploy;
```

The plugins functionality will now only be executed when the Serverless services provider matches the provider name which is defined inside the plugins constructor.

## Plugin registration process

A user has to define the plugins they want to use in the root level of the
`serverless.yml` file:

```yml
plugins:
  - custom-plugin-1
  - custom-plugin-2
```

We do not auto-detect plugins from installed dependencies so users do not run into any surprises and we cut down on the startup time of the tool. Through JSON-REF users can share configuration for used plugins between
`serverless.yml` files in one repository.

After the `serverless.yml` configuration file is loaded the plugin system will load all the commands and plugins and initialize the plugin system.

## Plugin options

Sometimes your plugin needs to setup some custom options. The `serverless.yml`
file provides the `custom` section where you can add options your plugin can use.

```yml
plugins:
  - my-greet-plugin

custom:
  greeting: hello
```

## Plugin Order

Plugins are registered in the order they are defined through our system and the
`serverless.yml` file. By default we will load the
[core plugins](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/lib/plugins/) first, then we will load all plugins according to the order given in the
`serverless.yml` file.

This means the Serverless core plugins will always be executed first for every lifecycle event before 3rd party plugins.
If external plugins should be running before our plugins they should generally be able to hook into an earlier lifecycle
event.

## Command naming

Command names need to be unique. If we load two commands and both want to specify the same command (e.g. we have an integrated command `deploy` and an external command also wants to use `deploy`) the Serverless CLI will print an error and exit. Commands need to be unique in the current service context they are executed. So if you want to have your own `deploy` command you need to name it something different like `myCompanyDeploy` so they don't clash with existing plugins.

# Building provider integrations

Integrating different infrastructure providers happens through the standard plugin system.
Take a look at the ["building plugins"](./01-creating-plugins.md) documentation to understand how the plugin system works.

## Provider specific plugins

You can add the providers name inside the constructor of your plugin. This makes it possible to only execute your plugins logic when the Serverless service uses the provider you've specified in your plugin.

## Deployment

Infrastructure provider plugins should bind to specific lifecycle events of the `deploy` command to compile the function and their events to provider specific resources.

### Deployment lifecycle

Let's take a look at the [core `deploy` plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/lib/plugins/deploy) and the different lifecycle hooks it provides.

The following lifecycle events are run in order once the user types `serverless deploy` and hits enter:

- `deploy:initialize`
- `deploy:setupProviderConfiguration`
- `deploy:compileFunctions`
- `deploy:compileEvents`
- `deploy:createDeploymentArtifacts`
- `deploy:deploy`

Plugin developers can hook into those lifecycle events to compile and deploy functions and events on your providers infrastructure.

Let's take a closer look at each lifecycle event to understand what its purpose is and what it should be used for.

#### `deploy:initialize`

This lifecycle should be used to load the basic resources the provider needs into memory (e.g. parse a basic resource
template skeleton such as a CloudFormation template).

#### `deploy:setupProviderConfiguration`

The purpose of the `deploy:setupProviderConfiguration` lifecycle is to take the basic resource template which was created in the previous lifecycle and deploy the rough skeleton on the cloud providers infrastructure (without any functions or events) for the first time.

#### `deploy:createDeploymentArtifacts`

The whole service get's zipped up into one .zip file.

Serverless will automatically exclude the following files / folders to reduce the size of the .zip file:

- .git
- .gitignore
- .serverless
- serverless.yaml
- serverless.yml
- .DS_Store

You can always include previously excluded files and folders if you want to.

#### `deploy:compileFunctions`

Next up the functions inside the `serverless.yml` file should be compiled to provider specific resources and stored into memory.

#### `deploy:compileEvents`

After that the events which are defined in the `serverless.yml` file on a per function basis should be compiled to provider specific resources and also stored into memory.

#### `deploy:deploy`

The final lifecycle is the `deploy:deploy` lifecycle which should be used to deploy the previously compiled function and event resources to the providers infrastructure.

### Amazon Web Services provider integration

Curious how this works for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) provider integration?

Here are the steps the AWS plugins take to compile and deploy the service on the AWS infrastructure in detail.

#### The steps in detail

1. The `serverless.yml` file is loaded into memory
2. A default AWS CloudFormation template is loaded and deployed to AWS (A S3 bucket for the service gets created)(`deploy:setupProviderConfiguration`)
3. The functions of the `serverless.yml`
4. Each functions events are compiled into CloudFormation resources and stored into memory (`deploy:compileEvents`)
5. Old functions (if available) are removed from the S3 bucket (`deploy:deploy`)
6. The service gets zipped up and is uploaded to S3 (`deploy:createDeploymentArtifacts` and `deploy:deploy`)
7. The compiled functions, event resources and custom provider resources are attached to the core CloudFormation template and the updated CloudFormation template gets redeployed (`deploy:deploy`)

#### The code

You may also take a closer look at the corresponding plugin code to get a deeper knowledge about what's going on behind the scenes.

The full AWS integration can be found in [`lib/plugins/aws`](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/lib/plugins/aws).
